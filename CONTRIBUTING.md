    ./run-tests

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

    ./run-tests

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/michaelengland/Muffin/compare/).

At this point you're waiting on us. We will try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
